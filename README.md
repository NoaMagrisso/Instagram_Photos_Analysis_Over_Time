# Analyzing Instagram Media Over Time for Zoo Business Insights
Analysis of Instagram photos taken by visitors of the "Woodland Park Zoo" in Seattle over different periods of time, whose location is the zoo and/or the zoo is tagged in.


In this project [`Shaked Sapir`](https://github.com/shaked-sapir/) and I collected and analyzed Instagram Media about the "Woodland Park Zoo" in Seattle (Washington, United States) for business insights, using Image Classification and Geographic Data Mining as the final project under the "Data Mining" course at Ben-Gurion University.

When making insights on business attractions, such as placement of booth locations in entertainment sites and locating areas requiring frequent maintenance, a preliminary acquaintance with the different areas of the place which are observed by visitors over different periods in time, may contribute to the selection of areas to focus on  in the future, so that the booth owners can maximize their financial profit or making logistics much easier. As a case study, by analyzing Instagram media taken at the "Woodland Park Zoo” in Seattle (Washington, United States), we will locate the "hot" regions (most visited) in the zoo over time - per season/per month/per hour, so we can bring some business and financial insights to managers’ knowledge.

We provide an easy-to-use tool for displaying those changes over time on a heatmap intuitively, allowing food stall owners to deduce where to place their stalls, where to concentrate on cleaning and placing trash cans, etc.

#### Here you can see how, given a heatmap, you can add a marker in order to make decisions regarding the location of your stand, picnic areas, or anything you'd like - so it will be located close to the "hot" regions and display the coordinates of the point
